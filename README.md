# Chrome Extension: YouTube2Spotify

This is a Chrome extension that adds a Spotify icon next to YouTube music video 
links on Reddit. Clicking the Spotify icon will start playing the track in 
Spotify, either in the web player or the desktop application.

## Feature To-do List

* Update popup while you're looking at it with new tracks that were found.

## Bugs

* Some tracks show up in list without name, just artist. See /r/ClassicalMusic.
* When clearing track list, track count does not go to 0 until you reopen popup.
* Don't duplicate Spotify link for tracklist upon successive popup opens.
