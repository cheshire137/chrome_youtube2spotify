# YouTube to Spotify Playlister

This is a Chrome extension that adds a Spotify icon next to YouTube music video 
links on Reddit. Clicking the Spotify icon will start playing the track in 
Spotify, either in the web player or the desktop application.

This extension also adds a Spotify icon next to the subreddit name on Reddit. 
Clicking this icon will open a list of all the Spotify tracks found on the page.
You can turn this track listing into a playlist on Spotify.

On YouTube, if a music video is found on Spotify, a Spotify icon will appear 
next to the video name. Clicking that icon will start playing the track in
Spotify.

Clicking the ![YouTube to Spotify Playlister icon](http://github.com/moneypenny/chrome_youtube2spotify/raw/master/icon20.png) icon in your Chrome 
window will open a popup showing all the Spotify tracks found so far. You can
keep adding to this list by browsing other Reddit pages or YouTube videos.
When you're ready, click the 'web player' or 'desktop app' links to open the
list of tracks in Spotify. In this way, you can make a playlist spanning 
multiple subreddits such as [/r/Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music) and
[/r/listentothis](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis). Click the 'Clear 
Tracks' link to remove all songs from the list and start over.

You can choose whether to open Spotify links in the web player (default) or in
the desktop application.

## Why does this extension exist?

I subscribe to a lot of music subreddits on Reddit but I never find myself 
clicking their links for a few reasons:

* I'm already listening to a playlist in Spotify and don't want to stop what I'm listening to just to play one song on YouTube.
* I'm browsing on my iPad and don't want to watch a video on YouTube. I want background music playing while I do other things.
* Sometimes I want to make new playlists but I don't know which songs to choose. The music subreddits often have good suggestions, but I don't want to manually go through them and look up each song on Spotify myself.

## Feature To-do List

* Allow pulling a playlist from the Reddit API, instead of just links on the current Reddit page.
* Incorporate other sites, like Soundcloud or Vimeo, and try to find their Spotify tracks.
