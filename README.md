# Chrome Extension: Youtube2Spotify

This is a Chrome extension with the following goals:

* Add a Spotify link to music videos on YouTube. Clicking the link will do something with Spotify:
    * Look up the song on Spotify, most def.
    * Add the song to a general YouTube playlist in the authenticated Spotify account?
    * Let you specify a playlist each time you want to save a YouTube song?
    * Open the song on Spotify and start playing it?
* Add a Spotify link next to posts on Reddit that go to a YouTube music video. This should help with playlist creation while you're browsing subreddits like [/r/Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music).
