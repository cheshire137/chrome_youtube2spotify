# Chrome Extension: YouTube to Spotify Playlister

This is a Chrome extension that adds a Spotify icon next to YouTube music video 
links on Reddit. Clicking the Spotify icon will start playing the track in 
Spotify, either in the web player or the desktop application.

This extension also adds a Spotify icon next to the subreddit name on Reddit. 
Clicking this icon will open a list of all the Spotify tracks found on the page.
You can turn this track listing into a playlist on Spotify.

On YouTube, if a music video is found on Spotify, a Spotify icon will appear 
next to the video name. Clicking that icon will start playing the track in
Spotify.

Clicking the icon ![YouTube to Spotify Playlister icon](http://github.com/moneypenny/chrome_youtube2spotify/raw/master/icon48.png) in your Chrome 
window will open a popup showing all the Spotify tracks found so far. You can
keep adding to this list by browsing other Reddit pages or YouTube videos.
When you're ready, click the 'web player' or 'desktop app' links to open the
list of tracks in Spotify. In this way, you can make a playlist spanning 
multiple subreddits such as [/r/Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music) and
[/r/listentothis](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis). Click the 'Clear 
Tracks' link to remove all songs from the list and start over.

You can choose whether to open Spotify links in the web player (default) or in
the desktop application.
